              Contrary to popular belief, there are ways to sell your house fast
              even with extensive repairs in Salem, Oregon. Although you’ll
              likely have to sell it for much less, finding a buyer isn’t
              impossible. Some people would settle for cheaper properties only
              to renovate these themselves later on, or might even be interested
              in flipping properties for their own profit. Regardless of their
              intentions, this market is out there and waiting for your offer to
              come in!

            <p className="font-medium text-iron-gray">
              When looking for how to sell your house with extensive repairs,
              you might want to check for fixer-upper clients in Salem, Oregon.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium text-iron-gray">
              What’s a fixer-upper you might ask? These people are either
              budding interior designers or simply creative homemakers who want
              to remake a less-than-perfect home themselves. They’re normally
              okay with houses in need of repairs or contain other issues, only
              because they have no problem renovating these homes themselves.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium text-iron-gray">
              Try to see if you can find fixer-upper Facebook groups to post
              photos of your property in, or you can ask for a direct referral
              for a quick sale.

              Intend to disclose everything about the property before you sell
            </h3>
            <p className="font-medium text-iron-gray">
              Even though your buyers know you’ll be selling a home with issues,
              make sure that every detail is disclosed to them and that they
              understand the kind of property they’re looking at. You don’t want
              to be on the sore end of a potential lawsuit by failing to
              disclose a leaking roof or a bathroom that needs a plumbing
              overhaul
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium text-iron-gray">
              If you’re unable to make a thorough inspection yourself, feel free
              to set aside a part of your budget to hire a home inspector.
              Normally, they help buyers inspect a potential future home for any
              issues that need clearing up, but can also assist sellers if they
              need to disclose all of their issues to potential buyers.

              Hire an excellent real estate agent
            </h3>
            <p className="font-medium text-iron-gray">
              This is a great tip for sellers of any kind of property, whether
              it be brand new or with issues that need addressing. A good real
              estate agent not only has an excellent track record but is
              familiar with the real estate market landscape surrounding a
              certain area.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium text-iron-gray">
              Clients who would take a chance on a property with issues usually
              have very specific needs for finding these. A real estate agent
              can connect you with these clients more effortlessly, for a small
              fee of what you will eventually take home when the deal has been
              completed.

              Make easy and cheap repairs
            </h3>
            <p className="font-medium text-iron-gray">
              Although there are clients that would purchase your home as-is,
              it’s always a better idea to do some light repairs if you can
              afford to do so. This can marginally increase the value of your
              home so you can sell it at a higher price than you initially
              intended.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium text-iron-gray">
              Here are some cheap repairs you can make before putting your house
              up for sale:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc text-iron-gray font-medium p-3.5">
              <li>Painting</li>
              <li>Landscaping</li>
              <li>Updating your light fixtures</li>
              <li>Replacing window coverings and treatments</li>
              <li>Cleaning and replacing carpets</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="font-medium text-iron-gray">
              Not all of these repairs need to be made on your own, if you’re
              lucky with the client you end up talking to! It’s entirely
              possible for you and your buyer to work repairs out together such
              that they can cover some of the repairs themselves. This is
              normally something that fixer-upper clients won’t have trouble
              accepting, especially if they’re eager to tidy up their new home
              as best as they can with some help from you as the seller.
